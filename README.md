This is a very simple to implement triangle arbitrage bot.This takes advantage of the price 
difference between a apeswap and pancakeswap. It also utilizes a function in pancakeswap called flashswap 
Which is equivalent to taking a flash loan on the ethereum network. It allows you to borrow as much liquidity available as 
long as it's paid back in the same block transaction. Utilizes that to borrow as much wbnb
 that's available at the time of the execution of this script. By doing so it maximizes your profit. 

Here's a YouTube tutorial on exactly how to execute it

You will need the metamask extension installed in your browser if you don't already have it
Https://Metamask.io

You will need to configure metamask to use the bnb smart chain
